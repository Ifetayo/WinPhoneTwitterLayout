# WinPhoneTwitterLayout
Twitter layout for windows phone 8.
A hack on the twitter for windows phone 8 app control header layout. It was created to show a very easy and naive way of creating the layout.
This work is based on simplying this http://depblog.weblogs.us/2013/08/29/twitterate-your-windows-phone-app/.
Thanks to Depechie and also the good folks at metro studio http://www.syncfusion.com/ for the icons on this mockup.
In the analysis of my version there is a very tiny performance impact due to the creation of textblock objects for which the corresponding path binds the fill property to the textblock's foreground colour. But it's somewhat negligible in most use cases.

Enjoy!
